- CIPURSE is an ==open standard developed== by the OSPTâ„¢ Alliance designed for secure contactless transactions, particularly in applications like public transport, access management, and payment systems
- ### How it works?
	- Uses AES-128 Encryption
	- Uses 3-pass Mutual authentication (similar to #TCP 3-way handshake) 
	- Uses SAM(Secure Access Module) for the data storage of the keys

	- **Initiation**: The authentication process begins when the reader sends a request to the card. This request may include a challenge or a random number generated by the reader.
	- **First Pass (Card Response)**: Upon receiving the request, the card processes the challenge and generates a response. This response typically involves encrypting the challenge using a secret key stored securely on the card. The card then sends this encrypted response back to the reader.
	- **Second Pass (Reader Response)**: The reader, upon receiving the card's response, decrypts it using its own copy of the shared secret key. If the decryption is successful and the response is valid, the reader then generates its own challenge and sends it back to the card.
	- **Third Pass (Final Verification)**: The card receives the reader's challenge, encrypts it using the same secret key, and sends the encrypted challenge back to the reader. The reader decrypts this final response to verify the card's authenticity.
	
	- #### How could a tag or NFC card can do these encryption it doesn't make any sense? 
		- **Microchip Technology**: Standalone cards or tags typically contain a microchip (often referred to as an #EMV chip) that is specifically designed to handle encryption and decryption processes. This chip securely stores cryptographic keys and executes complex algorithms necessary for encryption.
		- **Key Storage**: The secure element within the card has a dedicated area for storing cryptographic keys securely. These keys are used for encrypting data during transactions. The design ensures that even if the card is physically compromised, the keys remain protected.
