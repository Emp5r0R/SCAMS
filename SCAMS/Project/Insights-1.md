* Typically Secured NFC's utilizes robust cryptography based on the [[CIPURSE]]
* By using these methods like in [[CIPURSE]] its very hard to replicate the frequency or data blindly.
* Base frequency 13.56 MHz

#### ==Please read further parts only after understanding CIPURSE ==
## What i am proposing?
	  As we can see "CIPURSE" uses TCP like protocol or pass exchange 
	  system but not itself.
	  We can possibly build a same but like SCTP. Like using 4-way pass 
	  method.
	  If we want to go easy we could build on CIPURSE by changing its 
	  encryption and decryption mechanisms
